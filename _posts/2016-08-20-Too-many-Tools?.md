title: Too many Tools?

# Tools and Frameworks
It seems like whenever I'm on the internet, checking [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [/r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming), 
there's a new tool/framework made that will "simplify" your coding experience and make your product that much easier to maintain. However, whenever I 
see another one of those posts, I just think "oh great, another framework, it's not like we have enough of those already." 

I definitely acknowledge the usefulness of tools, for example, that Atlassian provides. Jira gave me a task board, where I would pick up a task on any given
day and go to town on it until I'm finished. When I'm done, I put it on Crucible for code review, and Crucible allows my teammates to easily discuss changes on
the code I've written. Jira as a tool was incredibly helpful because it allowed us to organize tasks, and distribute work among my teammates. It was simple, 
straightforward, and it integrated well with other Atlassian tools. Essentially, the tools provided to me during my internship allowed me to focus more on the 
task at hand, than about how to use a certain tool.

However, there was definitely a time period when I first came onto the job, and had no idea how any of these ten tools provided to me worked. I worked incredibly
hard to get used to them as soon as possible so that I could start contributing to the team. That's when I started to wonder whether or not learning all these
tools would become a burden.

# Bottleneck or Not?
So, there's a ton of tools and frameworks out there. There are numerous sites where you can host your project, such as github, gitlab, bitbucket, even subversion. 
There's many options for keeping track of your Agile tasks, the one I used was Jira. There are plenty of IDE's, plugins, text editors out there. When I started 
to code, I picked the tools that seemed popular and just stuck with it because there was no way I was going to learn them all. However, once you start getting into internships
and jobs, you are forced to learn the tools that they have been using for a long time. That takes a bit of time to get used to, especially if you haven't seen any of them
used in the extent that a large company uses it. It made me feel unproductive, incompetent, and useless for that time period.

While pulling my hair out, trying to figure out how use Subversion without breaking the build and deleting the whole repository, I couldn't help but think that
maybe if there were just some standard tools that everybody used, I would be able to start working from day 1. It would make new interns and employee's lives easier
since they felt comfortable with the tools they would be working with. 

However, I do realize that even if it added a ton of simplicity, it doesn't make sense to stifle innovation and progress in terms of the tools we use just so 
programmers don't need to spend more time learning a better, faster, simpler tool. In reality, it doesn't take THAT long to learn a new, for example, version control
system like git. Git and Subversion are quite similar actually, and learning Git gets easier if you've used a form of version control in the past. So yes, why not 
adopt a new tool if in the future, it will make life so much easier? The pain of relearning a tool is probably nothing compared to the benefit that could come from
using it in the future.

**TL;DR** I got mad at having to learn 10 different tools/frameworks in my internship, started to wonder if there's too many tools out there. It's actually not that bad once I calm down.
