I recently bought a used Seagull S6 Classic from Dusty Strings, guitar shop in Fremont. I went with my friend who 
wanted to get his guitar fixed up, and his playing the guitar inspired me to pursue an instrument. I went with a 
guitar because I saw the only other option as the piano, which I didn't really want to play. Apparently Seagulls
are a decent entry level brand, and luckily there was a S6 Classic in pristine condition. 

I asked the store owner about what kind of guitar a beginner would be looking for, and he said that I don't want 
to go for the $100 dollar guitars sold on Amazon. They're made of wood that doesn't last long, and I would be going into 
the shop frequently for tune ups. $300 is around the price point I should invest into a guitar, just because guitars that
expensive have a much better build quality. The Seagull I picked up was around $350, while a new Seagull of the same
model costs $500. I was hesitant to buy the guitar, but for some reason I felt really compelled to learn an instrument, so here I 
am.

At some point, I'll be able to play songs well enough so that Eileen can sing along to them!
