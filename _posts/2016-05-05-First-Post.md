Since I've moved into Syracuse for the summer, I've found myself having a lot
more free time when I'm not working. So, I decided to start a blog! I'm not going
to treat this like a daily journal, but rather as a spot where I can write down my thoughts
and experiences that I think are important to me. I don't think any of my posts
will be award-winning or error free, but I believe if I keep this up long enough,
I will see the progress!
