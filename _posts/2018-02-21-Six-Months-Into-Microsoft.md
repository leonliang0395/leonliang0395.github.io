title: Six Months into Microsoft
---

So it's been about six months since I joined Microsoft. It's a company that spoils me.
If I were to take a different job in a company that isn't like one of the tech giants,
I could see myself being a litte miserable just because of the number of amenities I get.
Aside from the free drinks and super flexible hours, I would say Microsoft has forced 
me to learn not only totally different languages, but also how to prioritize tasks and 
balance quality vs delivery. 

I used to think quality code is the most important thing of all. However after working
on items in sprints that take an unexpectedly long time, I find that I tend to neglect
delivering items on time as well. I've noticed that my tendency to need to write perfect code
ends up delaying the completion of the item. Of course, it could be that the item
was too large to fit in a single sprint. However, now in order to complete the task in a timely manner,
I rely on my more experienced coworkers for assistance. That also provides the added 
benefit of learning from someone who has gone through it before.
