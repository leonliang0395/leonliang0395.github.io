# Company Bureaucracy is pretty annoying  
Most of my time was spent shooting emails at various points of contacts in order to get permission to use 
the dev tools I would need to work on my project. I assume that since it's a huge company and they have products that
are heavily regulated, security is one of their largest concerns. This means that
any program I have on my computer has to be authorized for my use. It has to be vetted to make sure
there's no malicious software that can compromise national security and secrets. Even my monitor
and keyboard have to be labeled as "unclassified"! It's because of these reasons that I 
understood having to wait through all the bureaucracy, but sitting around with nothing to do
and no authorization to do anything made me feel useless.

# Surprisingly, I Know a Lot about Programming
I couldn't understand any of the heavy technical jargon my teammates were spitting out 
at the daily Agile meetings. I had no idea what each acronym meant (neither did they), and I was overwhelmed by
their 600,000 line codebase. Also, since I was waiting to get access to the developer tools,
I didn't have a chance to skim through the modules and get some idea of how the backend works. 
I mean, I've always had a mild case of [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome),
but these two reasons made me feel like I learned nothing in my three years at Michigan.

However, as I got accustomed to the day to day workflow in the following weeks, I realized
that a lot of what I learned at Michigan applies to my project. Learning about Unix,
advanced C++ and the compilation process allowed me to quickly figure out what was going 
on behind the scenes. It turns out there was a lot that I was familiar with. The
only reason I felt stupid was that I was intimidated by my teammates and the task at hand.
I didn't want to fuck up the codebase with one commit, and I didn't want to embarass myself
in front of them. So, what I ended up doing was second guess every line of code I wrote, which
leads to me not writing code at all! Once I realized my teammates weren't gods of programming, 
I felt much more comfortable working with them. I'm starting to enjoy working there
more and more!

**TL;DR** Fuck bureaucracy and have more faith in your skills.
