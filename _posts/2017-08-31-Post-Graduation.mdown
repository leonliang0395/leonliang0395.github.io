title: Graduation and Post-Graduation
---

To be honest, I started this blog hoping it would motivate me to write regularly, but 
I've already taken a year-long break. That's how well it's going.

# Graduation
You know something's up when your school decides for its 200th birthday, they're going
to break from tradition and NOT bring a speaker for commencement. "Guess what guys, we have 
an amazing video of prominent PAST SPEAKERS to celebrate our history!" I mean, I guess
I understand that we should be celebrating the University of Michigan's past during the
200th birthday, but haven't you already celebrated it all year long? All of us have looked
forward to the commencement speaker because we believed an event so important as the bicentennial
would warrant a speaker just as important. But hey, at least we didn't get Trump right?

# Learning to Drive
So over the one month I had to myself this summer, I learned to drive. Long story short (it's actually not a long
story, it's just a boring one), I failed the first time because the proctor literally could not stop yelling at me. Then I 
took it the second time and passed easily. One step closer to becoming a full adult!

# Microsoft
I accepted the offer back in October of 2016. The thought of moving to Seattle got me really excited. I was always an East Coast kid, and there was no way I was going to give up working at one of the greatest tech companies ever. My team is super chill, the MACH cohort is amazing, and the amount of fun I've had in just a month and a half is just mind blowing.
