Since I've moved into Syracuse for my summer internship, I've found myself having a lot
more free time. That's why I decided to start a blog! I'm not going to treat this like 
a daily journal, but rather as a spot where I can write down my thoughts and 
experiences that I think are cool and important. You can expect a ton of posts 
on programming, but once in a while I might write about something else. I don't 
think any of my posts will be amazing, but I hope to see the progress I make
throughout the lifetime of this blog.
