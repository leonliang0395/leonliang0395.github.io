Clearly this blog isn't as aesthetically pleasing as many other blogs out in the internet
but it took much such a long time to set this up. I'm not particularly adept at HTML nor CSS
and I don't believe I'm much of a designer, but I figured it'd be a good side project
to create my own personal website. I started off with looking at other peoples' personal
pages online and I was looking for something simple. I wanted a page that just had my name,
what I am / what I do, and links to where people can find more information on me. At first I
only thought this was a good way to redirect people to my linkedin and github for recruitment
purposes, but later on I figured I wanted to write down the things I learn and what I think I can
make with that knowledge. This would help me brainstorm ideas, leading me to build more random things
and force myself to learn stacks on my own.

As for this website, my home page is really simple. In fact the hardest part of making it was
centering everything. When I searched online for how to center things in the middle of a page,
a ton of people didn't know how to! Other than that, I had a lot of fun picking out the color schemes
and I stumbled upon one that I really liked, which is the one I'm using right now. As for fonts,
I found the font called Proxima Nova Soft but when I tried to load the website on my friend's browser
the font didn't show up. I tried to look for solutions and I figured out that if the friend doesnt have
that font installed, they are not going to see it. So I tried to use "@font-face" but I just could not
get it to work. I eventually put it off, thinking I could get back to it later when I finish touching up my blog.

Eventually what I have planned is to have the same color background as my landing page, but with an endless
white block in the middle where you can look at my blog posts. I have no idea how to do it right now
but I'm already really excited that my blog posts are showing on my website!

Wish me luck guys.
