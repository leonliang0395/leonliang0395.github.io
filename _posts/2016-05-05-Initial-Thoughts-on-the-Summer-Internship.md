title: Initial Thoughts on the Summer Internship
---

Since I've moved into Syracuse for the summer, I've found myself having a lot
more free time to do things such as start a blog! I don't intend for this blog
to be like a diary, but rather about topics and events I find important and 
interesting in my life.
