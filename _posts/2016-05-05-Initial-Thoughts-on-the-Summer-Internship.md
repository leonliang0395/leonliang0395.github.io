title: Initial Thoughts on the Summer Internship
---

Since I've moved into Syracuse for the summer, I've found myself having a lot
more free time when I'm not working! So, I decided to start a blog, which I have
been wanting to do for a while. I don't intend for this blog
to be like a diary, but rather about topics and events I find important and 
interesting in my life.
