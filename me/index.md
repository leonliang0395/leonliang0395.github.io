# What do you do?
Other than programming, I love to play video games and watch tv shows!
Over the past few months, I've been weening myself off League of Legends because that game makes me
want to smash my face into my keyboard. Blizzard released Overwatch recently, so I've been obsessed
with that game, even if it also makes me want to facedesk. Clearly, there's a trend in the type of
games I like to play.

# What programming languages do you use?
I'd like to think of myself as being pretty decent in C++. I've dabbled in Web Development in my previous projects, where I used Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.
