# What do you do?
Other than programming, I love to play video games and watch tv shows!
Over the past few months, I've been weening myself off League of Legends because that game makes me
want to smash my face into my keyboard. Blizzard released Overwatch recently, so I've been obsessed
with that game, even if it also makes me want to facedesk. Clearly, there's a trend in the type of
games I like to play.

# What programming languages do you use?
I'd like to think of myself as being pretty decent in C++. I've dabbled in Web Development in my previous projects, where I used Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 

# Why do you want to program?
I'll be honest, I went into computer science because I was pretty good at it, and it was relatively fun. I
didn't really have a concrete reason for wanting to code. However, during the end of my Junior year, I was an intern
in a company that dealt with incredibly impactful products. I was only really doing unit testing and refactoring,
so I felt as if I didn't have much of an impact on the project itself. One day, the customer came in and
told us that the product we worked on saved lives. They used it to protect a village in Afghanistan,
and it worked perfectly, and they could not thank us enough. After talking to the customer, the work
I did felt so much more meaningful. Even if I was only writing test cases, it helped ensure that the product worked the
way it was intended. 

After the internship, I realized that the work I do, no matter how boring, has a huge impact on 
other people's lives. For example, in my Software Engineering class, we're working on projects that
benefit people specifically with disabilities and disorders. These are people with cerebral palsy, autism, blindness, etc.
They don't have fine motor skills, and we need to create products that cater to them, so that they can enjoy technology just as much as we do. 

I want to program because I've realized my skills give me the ability to help other people through technology. I could be working on
a web app, iOS app, missile-detecting radar, video game for the disabled, and I would know that each line of code I write
has a lasting impact on the product and the customer.
