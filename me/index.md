# What do you do?
I work on migrating a huge Revenue Reporting system at Microsoft to the cloud using Scala, Spark, and numerous Azure services. Outside of work, I've started getting into cooking Cantonese cuisine. My grandfather is an incredible cook, and unfortunately I am only now realizing how great of a resource he is for recipes and techniques.


# What programming languages do you use?
I'm currently using Scala at Microsoft. It's a really powerful language, but really hard to master. C++ has a special place in my heart because it's the language I've used throughout college, and I really enjoyed the amount of control I had over everyting. Last but not least, a bit of web development here and there exposed me to Python, C#, and Javascript.
