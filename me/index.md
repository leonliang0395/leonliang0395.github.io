# What do you do?
Other than programming, I love to play video games and watch tv shows!
Over the past few months, I've been weening myself off League of Legends because that game makes me
want to smash my face into my keyboard. Blizzard released Overwatch recently, so I've been obsessed
with that game, even if it also makes me want to facedesk. Clearly, there's a trend in the type of
games I like to play.

# What programming languages do you use?
I'd like to think of myself as being pretty decent in C++. I've dabbled in Web Development in my previous projects, where I used Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 

# Why do you want to program?
I'll be honest, I went into computer science because I was pretty good at it, and it was relatively fun. I
didn't really have a concrete reason for wanting to code. During the end of my Junior year, I was an intern
in a company that dealt with incredibly impactful products. I was only really doing unit testing and refactoring,
so I felt as if I didn't have much of an impact on the project itself. One day, the customer came in and basically
told the team that this product itself saved a whole village. Once I heard that, I felt that the work I did 
was so much more meaningful. Even if I was only writing test cases, it help ensure that the product worked the
way it was intended, otherwise bugs can happen and consequences arise. 

After the internship, I realized that the work I do, no matter how boring, has the potential of helping people
either directly or indirectly. For example, in my Software Engineering class, we're working on projects that
benefit people specifically with disabilities and disorders. These are people with cerebral palsy, autism, blindness, etc.
They can't type normally on an iPhone's keyboard. They don't have fine motor skills, and we need to create products
that cater to them, so that they can enjoy technology just as much as we do. 

I want to program because I've realized my skills allow me to help other people through technology. I could be working on
a web app, iOS app, missile-detecting radar, video game for the disabled, and I would know that each line of code I write
has a lasting impact on the product, and ultimately on the customer.
