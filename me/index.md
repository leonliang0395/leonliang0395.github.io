# What do you do?
I recently bought a guitar, so I'm devoting a good amount of time to learning how to play songs so others can sing along to them. I've also started keeping a journal of chinese food recipes. I've have an immense appreciation for the types of food my grandparents cook, so I devote some time to learning Cantonese cuisine. I also really enjoy watching Esports and playing video games.


# What programming languages do you use?
I'm currently using Scala at Microsoft. It's a really powerful language, but really hard to master. C++ has a special place in my heart because it's the language I've used throughout college, and I really enjoyed the amount of control I had over everyting. A bit of web development here and there exposed me to Python, C#, and Javascript.
