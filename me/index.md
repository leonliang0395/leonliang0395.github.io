Hey there, I'm Leon and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Currently I'm interning at Lockheed Martin in Syracuse, NY doing Software Development.

# What do you do?
Well, other than programming, I love to play video games and watch tv shows.
Over the past few months, I've been weening myself off League of Legends because that game makes me
want to smash my face into my keyboard. Luckily, Blizzard released Overwatch recently, so I've been obsessed
with that game.

# What programming languages do you use?
I'd like to think of myself as being pretty decent in C++. I've dabbled in Web Development in my previous projects, where I used Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.
